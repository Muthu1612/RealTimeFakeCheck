TODO: This is prerequisite for video pipeline implementation. Create video, audio and image embeddings using
the notebooks in src/notebooks and save them in embeddings/ folder.
Train the fusion model using train_fusion.py script and save the trained model in artifacts/ folder.

TODO: Load one single video file using video loader, create audio, video and 
image embeddings using encoders and import the torch model saved in artifacts.
Then pass the embeddings through the fusion model to get the final prediction.
